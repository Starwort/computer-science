        <p>
            Oxford is a city in central southern England, the home of the University of Oxford. The city is the county town of Oxfordshire, and forms a district within the county. <br> It has a population of just under 165,000, of whom 153,900 live within
            the district boundary. It lies about 50 miles (80 km) north-west of London. The rivers Cherwell and Thames (also sometimes known as the Isis locally) run through Oxford and meet south of the city centre.
        </p>
        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>
            Oxford has a maritime temperate climate ("Cfb" by the K&ouml;ppen system). Precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year and is provided mostly by weather systems that arrive from the Atlantic. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Oxford
