# Overview of 1.1 Components of a computer and their uses

## [1.1.1 Structure and function of the processor](./subsection_1)

01. &#x200b;
    - Arithmetic and Logic Unit; ALU
    - Control Unit and Registers:
        - Program Counter; PC
        - Accumulator; ACC
        - Memory Address Register; MAR
        - Memory Data Register; MDR
        - Current Instruction Register; CIR
    - Buses:
        - Data bus
        - Address bus
        - Control bus
        - How these relate to assembly language programs
02. The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle; including its effects on registers
03. The factors affecting the performance of the CPU:
    - Clock speed
