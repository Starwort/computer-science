## Exercises

- ​
    - ​
        - It allows the students to interact with the software
        - It displays the audiovisual feedback to the students
    - ​
        - It displays the information in a more interesting way for the students

- ​
    - Dot matrix as it strikes the paper, making printing on multipart paper easer and enables carbon copies to work properly
    - Laser as it is high-quality and high-speed; it is highly efficient for printing large quantities
    - Inkjet as it has extremely high DPI compared to equivalent-price laser printers and because of this can produce photorealistic prints
- LCD, as it is low-power - meaning it can operate on the plane for hundreds of seats, without increasing the fuel requirement to an unreasonable amount - consider the tyranny of the rocket equation
