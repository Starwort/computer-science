## Exercises

- ​
  - Data is written by 'burning' the disc with a high-power laser, changing its chemical properties to make it less reflective; and is read by a lower-power laser that is testing how reflective the surface of the disc is
  - ​
    1. The disc could have been scratched while in storage, rendering the disc unreadable
    1. The disc could have been exposed to extreme light or heat, corrupting the data on it
- ​
  - Solid-state drives have no moving parts - where a hard disk drive has magnetic discs and read-write heads, the SSD has a circuit board with a series of floating gates on it, which trap electrons to measure an 'on' state. Solid-state drives also have no way of unsetting a single gate - an entire 'block' (roughly equivalent to a sector on a HDD) must be cleared at once - whereas the HDD can polarise any individual bit to either state.
  - ​
    1. Faster access
    1. Lower power usage
    1. Silent operation
    1. Highly portable and resistant to shock damage
