   - &#x200b;
     1. Cost of software
     2. Ability to insert special items e.g. formulae
   - &#x200b;
     1. Suitability for purpose
     2. Ability to run on hardware available

## Exercises

  - &#x200b;
    - Software used to run the system and its applications
    - Software that performs an operation for the user
  - &#x200b;
    - Ubuntu (distribution of Linux)
    - Visual Studio Code (with which I am creating this file)

  1. As it has already been made, the cost will be shared between all the users; and therefore will be cheaper to purchase
  2. It will have been well-tested meaning that there will be fewer bugs
  3. It has been made already and therefore can be installed immediately

  - Compression software is used to reduce the size of files on disk. The student will use this to compress his project work files, as well as his music and video
  - Anti-virus software is used to protect a computer from malware. The student would use this to prevent his computer from being infected via the internet, or disinfect his computer after a security breach
  - A backup utility is used to create full or incremental backups of every file on a user's computer. The student could use this to recover his project work following a huge mistake, or theft/loss/damage of his PC
