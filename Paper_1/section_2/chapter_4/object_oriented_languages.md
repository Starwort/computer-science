  - **Encapsulation** is the independence of an object's methods and attributes from all other objects of its class.
  - &#x200b;
    - **Instantiation** of an object is where the object is created, with a set of attribute values unique that instance. Only a specific instance of a class can read/write to the attributes of that instance
    - `member = new Member("A456", "John", "Bell", "07981 345987")`

    - `type`
    - `spin_web`
- &#x200b;
  - The practice of having a programming language interpret an object differently depending on its class, via subclassing and method overriding
  - &#x200b;
    - Assuming the procedure call is implied:

      > Birds can fly
      > Seabirds can fly and swim

      Otherwise, nothing.
    - `bird1` is an instance of `Bird`. Therefore it uses `Bird`'s `move` procedure - and prints `Birds can fly`.

      `bird2` is an instance of `Seabird`. `Seabird` inherits `move` from `Bird`, but then **overrides** it with its own `move` method, which prints `Seabirds can fly and swim`.
