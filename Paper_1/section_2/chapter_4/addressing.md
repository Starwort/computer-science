# Addressing modes

## Immediate addressing

- The operand is used directly
    - This is the fastest mode as it does not use main memory at all

## Direct addressing

- Also known as absolute addressing
- The operand is used as a memory address to read to find out the new operand
    - This is second fastest as it only requires one operation in RAM
