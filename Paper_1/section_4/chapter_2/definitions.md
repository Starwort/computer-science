# Data structures definitions

- Stack
  - A Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure; the last item placed into the stack is the first one to be removed.
- Queue
  - A queue is a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure; the first item placed into the queue is the first one to be removed.
- List
  - A list is a dynamic data structure that organises data by index, so there is no need to set up a structure in advance. Data in these structures can be modified, added, or deleted at any stage.
- Array
  - An array is a static data structure that stores data under a single identifier by index. Arrays may be multi-dimensional, for example, a two-dimensional array is a table of data with rows and columns.
