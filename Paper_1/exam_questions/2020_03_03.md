# Exam questions (done on 03/03/20)

← [Back to Exam Questions](./index.html)

All tests were out of 20, therefore the teacher would like to know the average score per student.

Write the pseudocode to calculate the average score for each pupil.

[array 'scores' is 5x4]

```SPLIWACA
FOR pupil IN (0 TO 3 STEP 1) DO
    SET total TO 0
    FOR day IN (0 TO 4 STEP 1) DO
        SET total TO total + scores[day, pupil]
    END FOR // next day
    print("pupil "&pupil&" scored an average of "&(total/5)&"pts during the week")
END FOR // next pupil
```
