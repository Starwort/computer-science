# LMC advanced

## Advanced Challenge 1

Ask the user for a big number, then a small number. Using only a **BRP**, to **loop** round, keep subtracting the smaller number until you get past zero, then output the result.

```lmc
// Ask the user for a big number, then a small number. Using only a BRP to loop round, keep subtracting the smaller number until you get past zero, then output the result.
        INP
        STA 0
        INP
        STA 1
        LDA 0
        BRP 8
        // how dare you, don't enter a negative number :(
        OUT
        HLT
        SUB 1
        BRP 8
        OUT

## Advanced Challenge 2

To declare a **constant** you need to write it like this:  
`one DAT 1` (this will give the variable `one` the value 1 and it will not change).  
Using this, add to your previous program to count the number of times you can successfully subtract the smaller number.

```lmc
// To declare a constant you need to write it like this:
// one DAT 1 (this will give the variable one the value 1 and it will not change).
// Using this, add to your previous program to count the number of times you can successfully subtract the smaller number.

        STA 1
        LDA 0
        BRP 11
        // how dare you, don't enter a negative number :(
        OUT
        LDA 9
        OUT
        HLT
        DAT 1
        SUB 1
        STA 0
        LDA 9
        ADD 10
        STA 9
        LDA 0
        BRP 11
        OUT
        LDA 9
        SUB 10 // this is due to an off-by-one error
        OUT
