<li><p>'The Megahertz Myth' is the name given to the argument that clock speed alone is an insufficient method to compare the performance of processors</p>
<p>Discuss the extent to which you agree with this argument. You should include any other factors that might affect a processor's performance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I fully agree with this argument. Besides clock speed, there are several factors that affect performance.</p>
<p>One factor that can affect performance is the number of cores in the processor; more cores = more sets of ALU, CU, registers, and cache to execute instructions.</p>
<p>Another factor that affects performance is pipelining; the ability to process more than one fetch-decode-execute cycle at once - generally up to three can be done concurrently per core.</p>
<p>A third factor that affects performance is the instruction set - different instruction sets can require different numbers of cycles to perform each instruction.</p>
<p>A further factor that affects performance is cache. Having more cache allows more instructions and data to be stored; and having faster cache allows for faster read/write to the stored information.</p>
<p>A final factor that affects performance is speculative processing. Speculative processing is a process by which the processor, while waiting for the current instruction, begins to execute the next instruction - without committing the results to memory - so that if the program counter <em>doesn't</em> jump within that instruction, the results can be committed immediately.</p>
<p>It has to be admitted that clock speed makes a difference - higher clock speed means that more clock cycles occur in the same time and therefore more instructions are processed per second, all other stats the same.</p></li>
