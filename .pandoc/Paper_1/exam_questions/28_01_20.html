<li>An architecture firm specialises in designing skyscrapers.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The firm uses high end computers with high performance CPUs, GPUs, and large amounts of RAM
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Give <strong>one</strong> use the firm might have for GPUs.
<ul>
<li>Visualising the skyscrapers they are designing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Describe what is meant by the term 'RAM'
<ul>
<li>Random Access Memory. It is the main form of memory the computer uses. It stores data and instructions temporarily, while they are being used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>State one characteristic a high performance CPU might have.
<ul>
<li>High clock speed</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>A digital coffee making machine has a CPU that uses the Little Man Computer Instruction Set.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Little Man Computer operates on a computer system based on the Von Neumann Architecture
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>State <strong>two</strong> features of the Von Neumann architecture.
<ul>
<li>One main memory for data and instructions</li>
<li>CPU that runs with the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle in order to execute instructions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Describe <strong>one</strong> feature, <strong>not</strong> part of the standard Von Neumann architecture, which contemporary CPUs may have in order to improve performance.
<ul>
<li>Contemporary CPUs may utilise pipelining to improve their performance - each component of the CPU is kept busy by offsetting multiple input streams such that the Fetch, Decode, and Execute cycles happen concurrently for contiguous instructions</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>See And Believe is a company that specialises in CGI for films. Producing CGI requires a lot of processing power and so the company has a large number of high-performance computers
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The processors in the company's powerful computers have fast clock speeds and large amounts of cache memory. Describe how each of these improves the processor's performance
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>fast clock speed
<ul>
<li>High clock speeds mean that the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle occurs more often, meaning that the processor executes instructions more often and therefore overall faster</li>
</ul></li>
<li>large cache memory
<ul>
<li>Large quantities of cache allows the processor to store more instructions data in high-speed memory, meaning it can read the instructions and write the data faster</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>​
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Processors following the Von Neumann architecture use registers
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Describe what is meant by the term 'register'
<ul>
<li>A part of the CPU that stores a single piece of data (that is the same size as the architecture's word size). It is volatile, meaning that it is reset when power is lost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Give <strong>one</strong> other feature of the Von Neumann architecture
<ul>
<li>Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>An example of a register is the Accumulator (ACC). Give a Little Man Computer instruction that will copy the contents of the accumulator into memory when executed.
<ul>
<li>STA</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another Register is the Program Counter (PC)
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>State what the PC holds
<ul>
<li>The address of the next instruction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Give the name of two Little Man Computer instructions that may change the contents of the Program Counter when executed
<ul>
<li>BRA</li>
<li>BRZ</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Von Neumann architecture uses a Control Unit and an Arithmetic Logic Unit
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>State the register in which the Arithmetic Logic Unit stores its results.
<ul>
<li>Accumulator</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tick the stage of the fetch decode execute cycle in which the register in part a. would receive a value from the Arithmetic Logic Unit Stage | Tick one ---- | :---: Fetch | Decode | Execute | ✓</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A processor executes 　<strong>a</strong> 　program following the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle. To do this it needs to make use of registers One of the registers used is the Program Counter (PC). Ordinarily it would be incremented by one each cycle
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>​
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify an instruction in the Little Man Computer <del>program shown in Fig.2</del> instruction set that would cause the PC to change in a different way
<ul>
<li>BRP</li>
</ul></li>
<li>State which register the contents of the PC would be copied to in order for the processor to access the next instruction
<ul>
<li>Memory Address Register</li>

<li>A Little Man Computer (LMC) variant assembly language program is stored in memory as shown in Fig. 3.1 ​ | Fig 3.1 | ​ --- | --- | --- 0 | LDA | &amp;7 1 | ADD | #4 2 | OUT | 3 | HLT | 4 | DAT | 6 5 | DAT | 2 6 | DAT | 10 7 | DAT | 15 8 | DAT | 16 9 | DAT | 17 In this variant of LMC the symbols &amp; and # are used to denote different modes of addressing
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Given that the output is 17, state the addressing mode represented by each symbol

<p>An assembler is used on the code.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Describe what is meant by the term 'assembler'
<ul>
<li>An assembler takes assembly code and converts it to machine code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explain how pipelining would help a CPU execute the code in Fig. 3.1 more quickly
<ul>
<li>Pipelining would allow the CPU to execute the instructions more quickly as it prevents any component from being idle.</li>
